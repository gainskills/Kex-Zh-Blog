Update at Jan-26-2019:

I have been running blogs for years, started at [NetEase](https://blog.163.com/excellent_2008)(NetEase shutdown its blog service at Nov-30-2018), then to [Blogger](http://69444091.blogspot.com/)(The blog was closed), and [wordpress](http://hanbaobao2005.wordpress.com) after Blogger was blocked within China. I setup the blog on [Git Page](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) because I still unable to get used to the wordpress editor even I have used it for more than 2 years.

As writing blog is one of my hobbies, my interest in technologies, and I like sharing my ideas with other. You will read

- The issues I met and the process how I solved it
- The translated (Chinese) english technical articles
