### Why this ariticle?
This article describes how I used certbot as the SSL certification. Thanks for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/) and [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), it provides a trusted certificate at zero cost.

### Why HTTPs?
> HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the update to HTTP that uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide security for connections between web browsers and web servers. Using HTTPS normally requires a certificate from a certificate authority, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, and will also require installing that certificate onto a web server. Certbot can help perform both of these steps automatically in many cases. HTTPS is an Internet standard.


### How it works

### Steps
1. Plan for folder structure

    ```
    .
    +-- certbot
    |   +-- conf
    |   |   +-- archive
    |   |   |   +-- domain-name
    |   |   |   |   +-- certificate.crt
    |   |   |   |   +-- chain1.pem
    |   |   |   |   +-- fullchain1.pem
    |   |   |   |   +-- privkey1.pem
    |   +-- log
    |   +-- www
    +-- certs
    |   +-- certificate.crt
    |   +-- private.key
    +-- dockfiles
    |   +-- docker-compose.ssl.yml
    |   +-- docker-compose.yml
    +-- nginx
    |   +-- nginx_ssl.conf
    |   +-- nginx_nossl.conf
    +-- Folder for frontend
    |   +-- ...
    +-- Folder for backed
    |   +-- ...
    ```

    Folders: certbot, certs, nginx are mapped per condition

2. Dockerlize the web app, web gateway (NGINX or Apache). I use NGINX in my sample.
